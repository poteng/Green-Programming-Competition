# Green-Programming Dubitare

This project tries to achieve extremly low energy consumption and good performance when solving a word-frequency problem.

Given an article and an integer n, the most nth frequency words need to be found out and listed.
The optimization related to algorithm design, parallel programing, and knowledge about ideal size of hash table.
